# Sky Scrapper (Weather App)

## Project Definition
Sky Scrapper is a feature-rich weather application built using Flutter, incorporating key concepts such as API calling, Shared Preferences, and network connectivity. The app offers a comprehensive set of functionalities designed to provide users with accurate and timely weather information for cities, states, and countries.

## Project Description
Sky Scrapper aims to be a reliable and user-friendly weather application, empowering users with accurate and timely weather information. By incorporating API calling, Shared Preferences, network connectivity checks, city/state/country-wise weather details, saved location functionality, light and dark themes, splash screen, and detailed weather screens, the app provides a comprehensive solution for users to stay informed about weather conditions in their desired locations.

## Project Objectives
- **API Calling:** The app utilizes API calls to fetch weather data from reliable weather data providers. This ensures that users receive accurate and up-to-date weather information for their desired locations.
- **Network Connectivity:** The app includes network connectivity checks to ensure uninterrupted access to weather data. In scenarios where network connectivity is unavailable, the app gracefully handles errors and presents an error screen, notifying the user about the network unavailability and suggesting alternative actions.
- **Light & Dark Themes:** Sky Scrapper offers a visually pleasing experience with customizable themes. Users can switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences, ensuring comfortable usage in different lighting conditions and personalizing their weather app experience.
- **Splash Screen:** The app features an appealing splash screen that creates a positive first impression on users. The splash screen can showcase the app logo, weather-related imagery, or a visually engaging animation, captivating users and setting the tone for their weather exploration.
- **Detail Screen for Each City/State Wise Weather Detail:** Each city or state's weather information is presented on a dedicated detail screen. This screen provides a comprehensive overview of the current weather conditions, along with additional details such as hourly and daily forecasts, precipitation chances, and sunrise/sunset times. Users can explore and analyze the weather data in depth for the selected location.
